11. When you read the second time, make notes.
12. Try to use other information in the text to make sense of difficult words.

### Reading actively
1. Skimming the text.
    - read the title, the introduction, any headings and subheadings, and the conclusion
    - read the first sentence of each paragraph (the topic sentence)
    - read teh concluding sentence of each paragraph
    - read the words highlighted in bold
    - look at illustrations (pictures, disagrams, tables)
2. Recalling your background knowledge about its topic.
3. Scanning for specific information.
4. In-depth reading to find the key points.
5. Making sense of texts containing difficult words.
    - their background knowledge about the topic
    - the context in which a word is used: the words, sentences and examples that follow it
    - their understanding about the way in which words are constructed in English
    - their knowledge of other languages. Many academic words will be failiar if you have some knowledge of French or another lanugage derived from Latin

### Adding notes
#### Short notes
- key words
- definitions
- translations of new words
- comments
- reference to related resources
- questions

#### Reorganising notes
- organising information into subtopics
- using a mind map
- using a table


### How to read critically
- You may consider your own reactions to the content of the text and it relevance to you personally. Analyse the way in which you plan to use the text.
- You may also wonder how far the content of the text can be trusted, in other words if it is reliable.
- The issue of objectivity.
- Find out when the text was written.

### Reasons for using source at university
- demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the subject
- evalute or compare the ideas and information from readings
- show how ideas from other writers have helped them develop their own views
- support the points they made and justify their decisions

### Summaries, paraphrases and quotations
| Names | Descriptions |
| ----- | ------------ |
| Summary | A very concise and reworded version of a source text that reproduces all the key concepts but leaves out details and examples |
| Quotation | One word, or a group of words, taken directly from a source text and included, within inverted commas, in the assignment |
| Paraphrase | The reworded version of a short section of the source text |

### Paraphrasing text
- replacing the words in the original text with synonyms
- reorganising the text

### The 5Rs of summarising
- Reduce: the summary is shorter
- Reject: it misses out the example
- Reword: it uses problems instead issues
- Reproduce: it is accurate
- Repackage: It compresses

### Quoting
#### Why use quoting
- provide eviden that support your point
- add an important detail to your text
- help highlight a point you have made
- give authority to your point

#### How to use quoting
- the quotation contains exact words used by the author
- the quoted text is placed within inverted commas
- the quoted text fits grammatically in the text
- the meaings expressed by the original author are not changed
- the author of the quoted text is acknowledged

### Referencing
#### Need to include a reference every time you:
- summarise other people's ideas, theroies or works
- paraphrase their work
- quote their words

#### Why include a reference
- references show the student has read about the subject
- the points the student makes will appear stronger to their reader if it is clear that the points are supported by evidence from other people's research
- others will be able to find and use the same sources that informed the student's work, which in turn allow them to check the validity and authenticity of the student's work, as well as develop and enchance their own understanding of the subject
- by doing so the student acknowledges the author or authors of the ideas ans words they used in their text

#### To avoid plaigiarism
- acknowledge the authors whose ideas and words are used in their text
- report these ideas either by using their own words (paraphrase) or by including a quotation

#### Harvard Referencing system
- an in-text citation in the body of their texts - this provides the author's name and the date the work was published
    - the surname of the author
    - the date when the work was published
    - the page number where the information and ideas be found
- an end-of-text reference at the end of their assignment - this is detailed information not only about the author and their work but also about the publisher
    - Surname of the author, initial. (date of publication) title (in italics and using initial capital letters), place of publication, publisher
