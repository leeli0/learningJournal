## signed-area-so-far function
## Fundamental theorem of calculus (in words)
Suppose that $f$ is a continuous function whose domain contains the numbers $a$ and $b$, and that $F$
is an antiderivative of $f$. Then the signed area between the graph of $f$ and the $x$-axis from $x=a$
to $x=b$ is equal to the change in the value of $F$ as $x$ changes from $x=a$ to $x=b$.

## Fundamental theorem of calculus
Suppose that $f$ is a continous function whose domain contains the numbers $a$ and $b$, and that $F$
is an antiderivative of $f$. Then
$$\int_{a}^{b}f(x) \, dx=[F(x)]_{a}^{b}$$.

## Constant multiple rule and sum rule for the square bracket notation
$[kF(x)]\_a^b=k[F(x)]\_a^b$, where $k$ is a constant

$[F(x)+G(x)]\_{a}^{b}=[F(x)]\_{a}^{b}+[G(x)]\_{a}^{b}$

## Constant multiple rule and sum rule for definite integrals
$$\int\_a^b kf(x) \ dx=k\int\_a^b f(x) \ dx$$, where $k$ is a constant

$$\int\_a^b (f(x)+g(x)) \ dx=\int\_a^b f(x) \ dx + \int\_a^b g(x) \ dx$$
